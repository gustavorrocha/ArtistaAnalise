I'll be taking flowers to the cemetery of my heart
For all of my lovers in the present and in the dark
Every anniversary, I'll pay respects and say I'm sorry
For they never stood a chance as if they could
When no one knows what it's like to be us

[Verse 2]
I've never seen the sky this colour before
It's like I'm noticin' everythin' a little bit more
Now that all the dust has settled
I rebut all my rebuttals

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
[Chorus]
Go easy on me, baby

Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

Tell me you love me
I love you a million percent

I don't recognise myself in the coldness of the daylight
So I ain't surprised you can read through all of my lies

I'm so far gone and you're the only one who can save mе

Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight

I'm a fool, but they all think I'm blind
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind
I don't have to explain myself to you

Pave me a path to follow
And I'll tread any dangerous road
I will beg and I'll steal, I will borrow
If I can make, if I can make your heart my home
Throw me to the water
I don't care how deep or shallow
Because my heart can pound like thunder
And your love, and your love can set me free

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I have promised I will love you 'til the end of time
Through it all, the good, the bad, the ugly, and divine
I will be the melody, the rhythm, and your rhyme

Can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it

[Post-Chorus]

You tease me with your control
Because I long to live under your spell

6;30 (Target Exclusive);7.0;I Drink Wine;"[Verse 1]
How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?
We're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down
By puttin' ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow
When I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine
They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice
And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
You better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin', tryin')
To keep climbin' (Climbin', climbin')
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser
[Chorus]
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants somethin', you just want me

[Verse 2]
Why am I obsessin' about the things I can't control?
Why am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know?
In these crazy times, I hope to find somethin' I can cling on to
'Cause I need some substance in my life, somethin' real, somethin' that feels true

[Pre-Chorus]
You better believe for you, I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)
High tides (High tides, high tides)
'Cause I want you so bad, but you can't fight fire with fire, oh

[Chorus]
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free
Everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me

[Bridge]
Listen, I know how low I can go, I give as good as I get
You get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all I've got left
Oh, I hope in time (Hope in time)
We both will find (We both find) peace of mind
Sometimes, the road less travelled is a road best left behind";2021-11-19

I know you've got things to do (I do, too)

I'm so hard to impress, don't leave me on this stretch alone
When I'm out at a party, I'm just excited to get home

[Chorus]
And dream about you
All night long

[Verse 2]
I don't know how you got through to me (I'm so cold)
It's all happenin' so easily (Like, oh, my God)
It's so hard to digest, usually, I'm best alone
But every time that you text, I want to get on the next flight home
[Chorus]
And dream next to you
All night long

[Verse 3]
Maybe it's the way you remind me of (Where I come from)
Or how you make me feel beautiful (And thеn some)
The sight of you is dramatic, one glimpsе and I panic inside
I get lost in our hours 'cause you possess powers I can't fight

8;30 (Target Exclusive);9.0;Woman Like Me;"[Verse 1]
You're driving me away, give me a reason to stay
I want to be lost in you, but not in this way
Don’t think you quite understand who you have on your hands
How can you not see just how good for you I am?
I know that you've been hurt before
That's why you feel so insecure
I begged you to let me in ’cause I only want to be the cure
If you don't choose to grow, we ain't ever gonna know
Just how good this could be
I really hoped that this would go somewhere
[Chorus]
Complacency is the worst trait to have, are you crazy?
You ain't never had, ain't never had a woman like me
It is so sad a man likе you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to givе for free and it is key
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me

[Verse 2]
All you do is complain about decisions you make
How can I help lift you if you refuse to activate the life that you truly want?
I know it's hard, but it's not
We come from the same place, but you will never give it up
It's where they make you feel powerful
That’s why you think I make you feel small
But that’s your projection, it's not my rejection
I put my heart on the line for the very first time
Because you asked me to and now you’ve gone and changed your mind
But lovin' you was a breakthrough
I saw what my heart can really do
Now some other man will get the love I had for you
'Cause you don't care, oh

[Chorus]
Complacency is the worst trait to have, are you crazy?
You ain’t never had, ain't never had a woman like me
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy

Oh, what have I done yet again?
Have I not learned anything?
I don't want to live in chaos
It's like a ride that I want to get off
It's hard to hold on to who I am
When I'm stumblin' in the dark for a hand
I am so tired of battling with myself, with no chance to win
[Chorus]
(Hold on)
Let time be patient
(You are still strong)
Let pain be gracious
(Love will soon come)
Just hold, hold on

I swear to God, I am such a mess
The harder that I try, I regress
I'm my own worst enemy
Right now, I truly hate bein' me
Every day feels like the road I'm on
Might just open up and swallow me whole
How do I feel so mighty small
When I'm struggling to feel at all?

Just hold on (Hold on)

I built a house for a love to grow
I was so young that it was hard to know
I'm as lost now as I was back then

It's about time that I face myself
All I do is bleed into someone else
Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears

[Pre-Chorus]
But, oh, my
Oh, my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak
[Chorus]
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried

[Verse 2]
I'm so afraid, but I'm open wide
I'll be the one to catch myself this time
Tryna learn to lean into it all
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
Looking back, I don't regret a thing
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by
Keep my heart safe till the time feels right

But, oh, my

All your expectations of my love are impossible
Surely, you know that I'm not easy to hold

My heart speaks in puzzle and codes
I've been trying my whole life to solve
God only knows how I've cried
I can't take another defeat
A next time would be the ending of me
Now that I see
[Chorus]
That love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

[Verse 2]
How unbelievable (Unbelievable)
Of me to fall for the lies that I tell (Lies I tell)
The dream that I sell (Dream I sell)
When heartache, it's inevitable (And unbearable)
But I'm no good at doing it well
Not that I care (I don't care)
Why should anything about it be fair?

[Chorus]
When love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

No amount of love
Can keep me satisfied (Satisfied, satisfied)
I can't keep up (Can't keep up, can't keep up)

'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right

Pave me a path to follow
And I'll tread any dangerous road
I will beg and I'll steal, I will borrow
If I can make, if I can make your heart my home
Throw me to the water
I don't care how deep or shallow
Because my heart can pound like thunder
And your love, and your love can set me free

21;30;7.0;I Drink Wine;"[Verse 1]
How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?
We're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down
By puttin' ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow
When I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine
They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice
And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
You better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin', tryin')
To keep climbin' (Climbin', climbin')
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser
[Chorus]
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants somethin', you just want me

[Verse 2]
Why am I obsessin' about the things I can't control?
Why am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know?
In these crazy times, I hope to find somethin' I can cling on to
'Cause I need some substance in my life, somethin' real, somethin' that feels true

[Pre-Chorus]
You better believe for you, I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)
High tides (High tides, high tides)
'Cause I want you so bad, but you can't fight fire with fire, oh

[Chorus]
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free
Everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me

[Bridge]
Listen, I know how low I can go, I give as good as I get
You get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all I've got left

Sometimes, the road less travelled is a road best left behind";2021-11-19

I'm so hard to impress, don't leave me on this stretch alone
When I'm out at a party, I'm just excited to get home

[Chorus]
And dream about you
All night long

[Verse 2]
I don't know how you got through to me (I'm so cold)
It's all happenin' so easily (Like, oh, my God)
It's so hard to digest, usually, I'm best alone
But every time that you text, I want to get on the next flight home
[Chorus]
And dream next to you
All night long

[Verse 3]
Maybe it's the way you remind me of (Where I come from)
Or how you make me feel beautiful (And thеn some)
The sight of you is dramatic, one glimpsе and I panic inside
I get lost in our hours 'cause you possess powers I can't fight

You're driving me away, give me a reason to stay
I want to be lost in you, but not in this way
Don’t think you quite understand who you have on your hands
How can you not see just how good for you I am?
I know that you've been hurt before
That's why you feel so insecure
I begged you to let me in ’cause I only want to be the cure
If you don't choose to grow, we ain't ever gonna know
Just how good this could be
I really hoped that this would go somewhere
[Chorus]
Complacency is the worst trait to have, are you crazy?
You ain't never had, ain't never had a woman like me
It is so sad a man likе you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to givе for free and it is key
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me

[Verse 2]
All you do is complain about decisions you make
How can I help lift you if you refuse to activate the life that you truly want?
I know it's hard, but it's not
We come from the same place, but you will never give it up
It's where they make you feel powerful
That’s why you think I make you feel small
But that’s your projection, it's not my rejection
I put my heart on the line for the very first time
Because you asked me to and now you’ve gone and changed your mind
But lovin' you was a breakthrough
I saw what my heart can really do
Now some other man will get the love I had for you
'Cause you don't care, oh

[Chorus]
Complacency is the worst trait to have, are you crazy?
You ain’t never had, ain't never had a woman like me
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy

Oh, what have I done yet again?
Have I not learned anything?
I don't want to live in chaos
It's like a ride that I want to get off
It's hard to hold on to who I am
When I'm stumblin' in the dark for a hand
I am so tired of battling with myself, with no chance to win
[Chorus]
(Hold on)
Let time be patient

Let pain be gracious

Just hold, hold on

I swear to God, I am such a mess
The harder that I try, I regress
I'm my own worst enemy
Right now, I truly hate bein' me
Every day feels like the road I'm on
Might just open up and swallow me whole
How do I feel so mighty small
When I'm struggling to feel at all?

I built a house for a love to grow
I was so young that it was hard to know
I'm as lost now as I was back then
Always make a mess of everything
It's about time that I face myself
All I do is bleed into someone else
Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears

[Pre-Chorus]
But, oh, my
Oh, my

I'll always yearn if I never speak

To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried

[Verse 2]
I'm so afraid, but I'm open wide
I'll be the one to catch myself this time
Tryna learn to lean into it all
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
Looking back, I don't regret a thing
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by
Keep my heart safe till the time feels right

All your expectations of my love are impossible
Surely, you know that I'm not easy to hold
It's so sad how incapable of learning to grow I am
My heart speaks in puzzle and codes
I've been trying my whole life to solve
God only knows how I've cried
I can't take another defeat
A next time would be the ending of me
Now that I see

That love is a game for fools to play

And I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)

How unbelievable (Unbelievable)
Of me to fall for the lies that I tell (Lies I tell)
The dream that I sell (Dream I sell)
When heartache, it's inevitable (And unbearable)
But I'm no good at doing it well
Not that I care (I don't care)
Why should anything about it be fair?

When love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)

No amount of love

To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry

Are running out of time

Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul
[Chorus 1]
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more

And all I can do is watch and cry

Life was a party to be thrown

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye

But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

When did it go wrong? I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down? I go round and around
Thinking about it all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said
[Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go?

Why were you so cold? Let the truth be told
Tell me, was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking? I gave you everything

To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (Other side)

From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you

Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
That I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and manmade
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But, it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh, it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

[Verse 2]
I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But, I would rather say it now in case I never get the chance

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

Please stay where you are, don't come any closer

It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us

You have given me something that I can't live without

[Verse 1]
I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul
[Chorus 1]
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

[Verse 2]
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

[Chorus 2]
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be

You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that

I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue

You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining

You know how to feel things

Hold me closer one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye

This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
Who blew me away, blew me away
And It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, buried them away

I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watched you wave and watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home, I call that home

And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Woke up feeling heavyhearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, it's calling me home

I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done

If it hadn't been for love
Never would've run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

Never would've seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Would've been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

Four cold walls against my will

Never would've gone to that side of town
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've took a mind to track him down
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've loaded up a forty-four
And put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
[Chorus]
We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

She, she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But baby, is that really what you want?
[Pre-Chorus]
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
She made a fool out of you and, boy, she's bringin' you down
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core

She is half your age
But I'm guessin' that's the reason that you strayed

Like when we creep out when she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours? (Bless your soul)

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds

Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

[Chorus]
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables

When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any sins
I had no idea of the state we were in

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head

[Chorus]
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more
[Verse 2]
When was the last time that you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head

[Chorus]
But don't you remember?

Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you'd find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name

[Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

127;21;6.0;He Won’t Go;"[Verse 1]
Some say I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew
I can't bear this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you left behind
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone
[Chorus]
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

[Verse 2]
So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead

[Chorus]
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own

128;21;7.0;Take It All;"[Verse 1]
Didn't I give it all? Tried my best
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to, well, having me around
Still, how can you walk away from all my tears?
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here

[Chorus]
But go on and take it (Take it)
Take it all with you
Don't look back (Don't look back)
At this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
[Verse 2]
Maybe I should leave to help you see
Nothing gets better than this
And this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it?
You're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this

But go on, go on and take it (Take it)
Take it all with you
Don't look back (Don't look back)
At this crumbling fool

Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh, if only, if only you knew
That everything I do is for you

But go on, go on and take it (Take it)
Take it all with you
Don't look back (Don't look back)
At this crumbling fool

Hold me closer one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters but you pushed me in
I've seen your face under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you

But we had time against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up

I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you

Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your walls around me and pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then but now I'm willing to learn

But we had time against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
Promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

Have I been on your mind?
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name?
Will I ever know
How it feels to hold you close?
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go

Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you

I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true
I fall short each time, every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer, closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all
Like a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed
And I'm just a child who longs on her knees

[Chorus]
But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you
[Verse 2]
So you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper, ""Will you leave your man?""
'Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
I won't stand by you

'Cause I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes

Who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes, and you're on your own
You can say, ""I chose to be alone""
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top
[Chorus]
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

[Verse 2]
Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down?
You give up everything you are
And even then, you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

[Chorus]
See, when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I've had enough of (love)

I'd always kiss and hold you tight
But lately you don't seem to care
You close the door
And leave me standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair

I quit
I'm movin' on

The other night we had a date
And you showed up two hours late
And though your hair was all in place
Somebody smeared their lipstick on your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place

You made me leave you
You made me tumble and fall

I don't want you at all

'Cause I love everything you got
Though your kisses fill me

Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt her figure before

[Verse 2]
A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh
[Chorus]
You can find him sitting on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

[Verse 3]
Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through

[Bridge]
There's no way I could describe him
What I've said is just what I'm hoping for

Baby, come on now, I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

[Chorus]
That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me

How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me, yeah?

[Verse 2]
Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough?
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm takin' these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest, you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hopin' one day I might hear you say

And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been, then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it 'round on me like it's my fault
See, I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time (each and every time)

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
[Verse 2]
These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too when

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head and
Turn me into a crumblin' fool

Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave
Just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in, I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over, send me spinning closer to you

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So, desperately, I try to link it with my head
But instead, I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again

Forgive me, first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why
Don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes
It's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring
[Verse 2]
This love has dried up, and stayed behind
And if I stay, I'll be a lie
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me, first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new
Forgive me, first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire

And everything you do's a game
When night comes, and you're on your own
You can say, ""I chose to be alone""
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top
[Chorus]
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

[Verse 2]
Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down?
You give up everything you are
And even then, you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

See, when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired

Dancing with the night

Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what

And outside only to find
A double taking, punching hard
And laughing at my smile
I get closer
You obviously prefer her

Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours

See, I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time (each and every time)

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her

These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it and you're not satisfied

Lately with this state I'm in, I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over, send me spinning closer to you

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down?

But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you

[Post-Chorus]
You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me, yeah?";2008-01-28
201;19;3.0;Chasing Pavements;"[Verse 1]
I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love, but
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you

[Chorus]
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
[Verse 2]
I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?

[Chorus]
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah

[Breakdown]
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?";2008-01-14
202;19;4.0;Cold Shoulder;"[Produced by Mark Ronson]

[Verse 1]
You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been, then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it 'round on me like it's my fault
See, I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time (each and every time)

[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
[Verse 2]
These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too when

[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her

[Bridge]
Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
And even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
I try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play

[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives

203;19;5.0;Crazy for You;"[Verse 1]
Found myself today singin' out loud your name
You said I'm crazy, if I am, I'm crazy for you
Sometimes sittin' in the dark, wishin' you were here
Turns me crazy, but it's you who makes me lose my head

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head and
Turn me into a crumblin' fool
[Chorus]
Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave
Just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

[Verse 2]
Lately with this state I'm in, I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over, send me spinning closer to you
My, oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare and gets me into my favourite mood

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

[Chorus]
Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me, boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you";2008-01-28
204;19;6.0;Melt My Heart to Stone;"[Verse 1]
Right under my feet is air made of bricks
That pulls me down and turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
Then, I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

[Chorus 1]
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love
[Verse 2]
Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So, desperately, I try to link it with my head
But instead, I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

[Chorus 1]
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

[Bridge]
Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground?
You build me up and leave me there

[Chorus 2]
Well, I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one
In love, I'm the only one in love";2008-01-28
205;19;7.0;First Love;"[Verse 1]
So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth, the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry

Forgive me, first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why
Don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes
It's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring
[Verse 2]
This love has dried up, and stayed behind
And if I stay, I'll be a lie
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me, first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new
Forgive me, first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire

[Outro]
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love, forgive me
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love";2008-01-28
206;19;8.0;Right as Rain;"[Produced by Jim Abbiss]

[Verse 1]
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes, and you're on your own
You can say, ""I chose to be alone""
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top
[Chorus]
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

[Verse 2]
Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down?
You give up everything you are
And even then, you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

[Chorus]
See, when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I've had enough of (love)

[Bridge]
Go ahead and steal my heart to make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt as much it did then
When we were both right, and no one had blame
But now, I give up on this endless game";2008-01-28
207;19;9.0;Make You Feel My Love;"[Verse 1]
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

[Verse 2]
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
[Bridge 1]
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

[Verse 3]
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
Know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge 2]
The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

[Verse 4]
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love";2008-01-28

Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye

[Chorus]
You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving nothing way too much, in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say, ""*Pfft*, I've known you longer, my dear""
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all
But we do, but we do, do-do-do
But we do, but we do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do
[Verse]
I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You'd think we wouldn't, we do, but we do, do-do-do
But we do, but we do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do

[Bridge]
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Your, your-your, your
Your, your-your, your...
Favoritism ain't my thing but
In this situation, I'll be glad
Favoritism ain't my thing but
In this situation, I'll be glad to make an exception (Woah, oh)

You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that

209;19;11.0;Tired;"[Verse 1]
Hold my hand
While you cut me down
It'd only just begun
But now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments
With your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle
Watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes
You were smiling in the spotlight
Dancing with the night
The night fell off your mind
[Chorus]
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

[Verse 2]
Where'd you go
When you stay behind
I looked up and inside down
And outside only to find
A double taking, punching hard
And laughing at my smile
I get closer
You obviously prefer her

[Chorus]
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Hey, I'm tired";2008-01-28

I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
""Is there anything I can do for you dear?""
""Is there anyone I could call?""
""No and thank you, please madame
I ain't lost, just wandering""

[Chorus]
'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
'Round my hometown
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now
[Verse 2]
I like it in the city
When the air is so thick and opaque
I love it to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

[Refrain]
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

'Round my hometown
